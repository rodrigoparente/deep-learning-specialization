# What is a Neural Network

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It consists of interconnected layers of nodes, or "neurons," which work together to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data. 

Key components of a neural network include:

- **Input Layer**: The first layer that receives input features (data) for processing.
- **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that transform input data through weighted connections and activation functions. These layers help the network learn complex patterns.
- **Output Layer**: The final layer that produces the output (predictions) based on the processed information from the previous layers.

Neural networks can be used for various tasks, including classification, regression, and pattern recognition, and they excel at learning from large amounts of data through a process called training.
