# Drivers Behind the Rise of Deep Learning

 - Basic concepts of neural networks have been around for decades but weren't as effective until recently;
 - In traditional algorithms, the performance (e.g., accuracy) improves with more data up to a point, after which it plateaus;
 - In Neural Networks, the performance often continues to improve with more data, especially with large networks;
 - This happens because bigger neural networks with more parameters can leverage large datasets more effectively.

# Facilitators

 - The rise of digital activities and inexpensive sensors has led to an abundance of data;
 - Improved hardware (GPUs, TPUs) and efficient algorithms support training larger networks;
 - Faster algorithms reduce training times, enabling quicker iterations and experimentation.

# Future Outlook

 - Continued growth in digital data contributes to ongoing improvements;
 - Advances in specialized hardware and networking enhance computational capabilities;
 - Ongoing innovations in algorithms drive further progress.
