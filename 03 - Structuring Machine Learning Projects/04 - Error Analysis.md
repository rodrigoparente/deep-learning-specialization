# Carrying Out Error Analysis

 - Error analysis involves examining mistakes made by your algorithm to gain insights into improving performance.
 - This process helps decide if efforts to address specific errors are worth pursuing.

**Error Analysis Example**

 - Suppose you have a cat image classifier with 90% accuracy on the dev set, but you’re not satisfied with this performance.
 - One suggested solution is to collect more dog photos to improve the model’s training.
 - To determine if this is the right approach, manually examine the classifier’s mistakes to gain insights.
 - You can do this by following these steps:
    - Collect about 100 mislabeled examples from the dev set.
    - Examine these examples manually and categorize the types of errors.
    - Count how many of these 100 mislabeled examples are pictures of dogs.
    - Estimate the impact:
        - If only 5% are dogs, collecting more dog pictures will only slightly reduce the overall error (e.g., from 10% to 9.5%).
        - If 50% are dogs, addressing this problem could significantly lower the error (e.g., from 10% to 5%).

# Cleaning Up Incorrectly Labeled Data

 - Incorrect labeling occurs when an example is given the wrong label.
 - Deep learning algorithms can typically handle random labeling errors in the training set, as occasional mistakes usually don't have a significant impact on performance.
 - However, these algorithms are less effective at managing systematic errors (e.g., consistently labeling white dogs as cats), as these can distort the model's learning.
 - Guidelines for fixing incorrect labels:
    - Apply the same correction process to both the dev and test sets to maintain consistency in evaluation.
    - Check labels for examples the algorithm got right, as well as those it got wrong, to avoid biased estimates.
    - Focus on correcting labels in the dev and test sets, as accurate labels are more critical for evaluation than in the larger training set.
 - Practical advice:
    - Manual error analysis, though time-consuming, is valuable. Reviewing examples directly can help prioritize further actions and improvements.
    - Even if it’s not the most exciting task, investing time in analyzing and correcting labels can enhance model performance and evaluation accuracy.

# Build your First System Quickly, then Iterate

 - When starting a new machine learning project, it's advisable to build your first system quickly and then iterate.
 - This approach helps in identifying the most crucial aspects to improve.

 - In machine learning, especially in domains like speech recognition, there are numerous potential improvements you could focus on, such as:
    - Handling noisy backgrounds.
    - Accented speech.
    - Far-field speech.
    - Children's speech.
    - Non-fluent expressions.
 - Without initial experimentation, it can be challenging to determine which of these directions to prioritize.
 - Even experienced practitioners may struggle to decide the best focus without first observing the system's performance.
 - Because of that, it's advisable to build your first system quickly and then iterate.

**Iteration Process**
 
 1. Set up a development/test set and a metric to establish an initial target, which can be adjusted later.
 2. Quickly build and train an initial machine learning system. The focus is on getting a working model, not perfection.
 3. Use bias/variance and error analysis to identify the system's weaknesses and prioritize improvements.
 4. Iterate on the initial system, refining it based on insights from error analysis and performance metrics.

Teams often overcomplicate their initial system, while fewer oversimplify. The key is to quickly build a functional model and refine it. If your goal is to create a working system rather than invent a new algorithm, focus on getting something functional fast. Use bias/variance and error analysis to guide further improvements.
